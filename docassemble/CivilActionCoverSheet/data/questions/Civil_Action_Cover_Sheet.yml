  Is the claim eligible for Superior Court? 
subquestion: |
  The Superior Court has original jurisdiction of first-degree murder cases and other crimes. In addition, it has original jurisdiction of:[BR]
  *  Civil actions over $50,000[BR]
  *  Matters where parties are seeking equitable relief[BR]
  *  Actions including labor disputes where parties are seeking injunctive relief[BR]

  This means that to be heard in Superior Court, your case must involve either claims of $50,000 or more, a mutual agreement to seek equitable relief, or a mutual agreement to seek injunctive relief.
